All required .jar files are in the lib directory, EXCEPT websocket-api.jar and 
servlet-api.jar, which you must copy from your tomcat installation, or be sure
that they are otherwise present in the classpath.

Importing the source code as existing ant project to eclipse will probably not
work. It is better to create a new java project and select the project directory
to be the source code location (ca_frontend), and set the required build path
variables manually.

Modify build.properties and *.properties files in /conf to enable your preferred
services.

See the wiki https://github.com/visuallabel/CAFrontEnd/wiki/Deployment-Guide for
more information for the deployment process.
