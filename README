Rename the build.properties.orig to build.properties. All required .jar files
are in the lib directory, EXCEPT websocket-api.jar and servlet-api.jar, which
you must copy from your tomcat installation, or be sure that they are otherwi$
present in the classpath.

Importing the source code as existing ant project to eclipse will probably not
work. It is better to create a new java project and select the project directory
to be the source code location (ca_frontend), and set the required build path
variables manually.

Modify build.properties and *.properties files in /conf to enable your preferred
services.
