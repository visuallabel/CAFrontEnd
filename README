Rename the build.properties.orig to build.properties. All required .jar files
are in the lib directory.

Importing the source code as existing ant project to eclipse will probably not
work. It is better to create a new java project and select the project directory
to be the source code location (ca_frontend), and set the required build path
variables manually.

Modify build.properties and *.properties files in /conf to enable your preferred
services.
