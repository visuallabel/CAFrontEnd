JSON in Java [package org.json]

JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format.
See http://www.JSON.org/

The files in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java.
It also includes the capability to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP
headers, Cookies, and CDL.

This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON packages
in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until
then, choose carefully.

The license includes this restriction: "The software shall be used for good,
not evil." If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different
package.
